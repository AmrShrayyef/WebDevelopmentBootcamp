   weakness not good for standing out
   to stand out use Complmentary Color pallets choosing 2 colors different from each other from wheel of colors

4- typographry: 
use serif typeface fonts to make your words stand out and make it look more serious and older
for letter header for legal company or  magazine

choose 2 fonts for 1 design choose them close to each other in shape so it won't look weird

5-hierarchy: our eyes always drawm to the title of the page big one not the small one so we need to 
            learn how to use this to our advantge to make customers look at what we want through colors also make
            what we want to look at is using a strong color or something that stands out in the site we are trying to make
            a- Color : if we have something bright and something greyed 
            b- size: like we said above it help drawing attention to something like put ur email and what we do in our website
            c-layout: block of text with pictures and different shapes and different hierarchy
            !!!important!!! : do not use wikiepidia style of design hard to keep customer look so long at same line 
            d- alignment : when using fonts location inside a box or a grid 
            !!!!important!!!: reduce the numbers of aligment points in a webpage
            e- white space : it is around ur words and elements it is very important to give spaces between things 
               make it look more expensive 
            f- audience : target in your design the people you are trying to sell to of u make a website
               for kids dont make it gloomy sad but colorful     

            felexiblity in building website is important !!!

 6- user experince UX:  try to make it simple sometimes and constant so make different parts of your 
    website same as each other to make user find it easy to navigate your website
    use F Layout to control how user read
    use Z Layout FOR example Facebook 
    think about mobile user experince when user browse your website on phone


   avoid Dark patterns : trick users by showing them good things that inside are bad like perfomring an action you 
                    dont need to make users buy more things or choose payed methods instead of free ways
