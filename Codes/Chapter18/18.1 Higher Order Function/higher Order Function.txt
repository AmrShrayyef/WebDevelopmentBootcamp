higher functions use other functions as input

when using inspect on a website we see for example $0 on an element on the page we can use it to access that element through the console
$0.innerHTML="amr" 
in this case it will target the h1 element and change its value to amr

0$.addEventListener("click" , function(){
    alert("hello");
})


debugger;
