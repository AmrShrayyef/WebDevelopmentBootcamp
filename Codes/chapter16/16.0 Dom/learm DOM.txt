incooprating java script:
1-  <body onload="alert('hello')";>
    it will load the java script when body elment loaded up in our site , not good practice

2-  <script type=text/javascript>
    ur java script code
    </script>

3-  index.javascript 
    through <script scr="index.js"></script>
    however you need to put the script in html page in correct posistion right at the end before body close tag
